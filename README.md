# UX improvements

- color picker appear nicely

- skill multiple selector - corner not rounded after selected state
- don't show colors that have been picked (color picker)
- new items shoul appear nicly
- should skill add to emp panel close after emp creation?

# Bugs

- code collapses if there is no more color left
- when grabbin a skill in emp's skill column the order is messed up (?)

# Backlog ideas

- activity log
- display who is editing the page currently

# Code quality

- create card component - normal and rounded
- create text input component
- create colors = how to theme with material ui
- text variants - heading, normal, bold normal
